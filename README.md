## Optimal control of random walk on a graph

Applications of MDP as in

Todorov, E. (2009). *Efficient computation of optimal actions*, PNAS **106** (28), pp 11478â€“11483

finding shortest path (with regularizations) to sets of nodes in a random graph.

#### Issues

When `tradeoff = 10`, normalization test of controlled transition probability fails probably just because of summation errors (5% error in norm). Yet, problem solved with high accuracy.
